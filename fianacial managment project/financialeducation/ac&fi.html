                <p>Investing involves using capital (money) to acquire assets with the expectation of generating returns over time.</p>
                <p>Returns can come in the form of income payments (e.g., dividends, interest) or capital gains (increase in asset value).</p>

        <div class="info">
            <p>At its core, investing is the process of putting your money to work 
                with the goal of generating positive returns over time. 
                These returns can come in the form of income payments (like dividends) or capital gains (when the value of your investment increases).
                 Essentially, you're allocating resources—usually capital (i.e., money)—with the 
                expectation of growing your wealth.</p>

                <li><strong>Creating a Budget and Emergency Fund:</strong> Establish a budget to allocate funds for investments. Also, build an emergency fund for unexpected expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversifying Investment Portfolio:</strong> Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) to reduce risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Conducting Research and Analysis:</strong> Investigate investment options thoroughly. Consider historical performance, market trends, and expert opinions.</li>
                <li><strong>Making Informed Investment Decisions:</strong> Based on research, choose specific investments that align with your goals and risk tolerance.</li>
